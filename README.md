This repository contains the front-end source code for the **Inventory (Stores)** subsystem of the **ICT Management System (ICTMS)** project. The Inventory subsystem is responsible for managing the registration, tracking, and display of store items and equipment used by the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary - ICT DIrectorate.
